# Milestone v1.0: GSD Quick Mode

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-19
**Phases:** 1-2
**Total Plans:** 3

## Overview

Quick mode adds a fast-path command (`/gsd:quick`) that executes small tasks with full GSD guarantees (atomic commits, STATE.md tracking) but skips optional verification agents. Quick tasks live in `.planning/quick/` separate from planned phases.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Core Command

**Goal**: User can run `/gsd:quick` (with interactive prompt) and have it execute with full state tracking
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Requirements**: CMD-01, CMD-02, CMD-03, CMD-04, EXEC-01, EXEC-02, EXEC-03, EXEC-04, STATE-01, STATE-02
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 01-01-PLAN.md — Quick command file with pre-flight validation and directory setup
- [x] 01-02-PLAN.md — Quick orchestration (planner spawn, executor spawn, state update)

**Details:**
- Implemented `commands/gsd/quick.md` (286 lines)
- Pre-flight validation (ROADMAP.md check)
- Interactive task description via AskUserQuestion
- Slug generation (lowercase, hyphens, max 40 chars)
- Sequential numbering (001, 002, 003...)
- Directory creation at `.planning/quick/NNN-slug/`
- Spawns gsd-planner (quick mode) + gsd-executor
- STATE.md "Quick Tasks Completed" table update
- Skips: gsd-phase-researcher, gsd-plan-checker, gsd-verifier

### Phase 2: Documentation

**Goal**: Quick mode is documented in all relevant locations
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Requirements**: DOCS-01, DOCS-02, DOCS-03
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 02-01-PLAN.md — Document /gsd:quick in help.md, README.md, and GSD-STYLE.md

**Details:**
- help.md: Quick Mode section (lines 132-145)
- README.md: Quick Mode section (lines 300-322) + utilities table entry (line 457)
- GSD-STYLE.md: Quick Mode Patterns section (lines 379-444)
- All documentation substantive (no TODOs/stubs)
- Tone consistent across files
- Accurate to implementation

## Progress

| Phase | Plans Complete | Status | Completed |
|-------|----------------|--------|-----------|
| 1. Core Command | 2/2 | Complete | 2026-01-19 |
| 2. Documentation | 1/1 | Complete | 2026-01-19 |

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**
None (decimal phase pattern used for quick tasks, not roadmap phases)

**Key Decisions:**
- No planner changes: Quick mode is orchestrator-level, not agent-level — SUCCESSFUL
- Decimal phases required: Maintains full traceability and state integrity — SUCCESSFUL (adapted to .planning/quick/ directory)
- No flags for MVP: Simplest possible interface — SUCCESSFUL
- Parallel wave execution: Matches execute-phase behavior — SUCCESSFUL
- Quick Tasks table in STATE.md: Better tracking than just Last activity — SUCCESSFUL
- Error if no ROADMAP: Maintains state integrity, no standalone mode — SUCCESSFUL

**Issues Resolved:**
- Phase 01 implemented directly without formal GSD workflow artifacts (PLAN.md/SUMMARY.md not created)
- Documentation placement decided: help.md after Execution, README.md after How It Works, GSD-STYLE.md after Scope Calibration

**Issues Deferred:**
- RESUME-01, RESUME-02: `/gsd:resume-work` decimal phase handling (v2 requirements)
- `/gsd:squash-quick`: Future enhancement if fragmentation becomes a problem

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Phase 01 has no PLAN.md/SUMMARY.md artifacts (implementation was direct)
- Low impact — functionality is complete and verified

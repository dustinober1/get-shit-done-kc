# Milestone v1.0 — Audit Report

**Milestone:** GSD Quick Mode
**Audited:** 2026-01-19
**Status:** PASSED

---

## Executive Summary

All functional requirements met. Cross-phase integration verified. E2E flows complete.

**Scores:**
- Requirements: 14/17 (82% - 3 requirements are v2/future)
- Phases: 2/2 verified
- Integration: 4/4 connections wired
- Flows: 1/1 E2E flow complete

**Note:** Phase 01 was implemented directly (command file created) without formal PLAN.md/SUMMARY.md artifacts. The implementation is complete and functional, but the workflow artifacts are missing.

## Phase Status

### Phase 01: Core Command

**Status:** COMPLETE (implementation)
**Documentation artifacts:** Missing (no PLAN.md/SUMMARY.md)

**Deliverables:**
- commands/gsd/quick.md (286 lines) - Fully implemented

**Verification:** Implementation verified via integration check
- Command exists and is functional
- All CMD, EXEC, STATE requirements satisfied
- Pre-flight validation, slug generation, numbering all working

**Tech Debt:**
- Formal GSD workflow artifacts (PLAN.md, SUMMARY.md, VERIFICATION.md) not created
- Phase was executed via direct implementation rather than planned execution

### Phase 02: Documentation

**Status:** PASSED
**Verification:** .planning/phases/02-documentation/02-01-VERIFICATION.md

**Deliverables:**
- help.md: Quick Mode section (14 lines)
- README.md: Quick Mode section + utilities table entry
- GSD-STYLE.md: Quick Mode Patterns section (66 lines)

**Verification Score:** 4/4 must-haves verified
- All documentation substantive (no TODOs/stubs)
- Tone consistent across files
- Accurate to implementation

**Tech Debt:** None

## Integration Status

### Wiring Summary

| Connection | From | To | Status |
|------------|------|-----|--------|
| Command reference | help.md | commands/gsd/quick.md | CONNECTED |
| Usage example | README.md | commands/gsd/quick.md | CONNECTED |
| Patterns doc | GSD-STYLE.md | commands/gsd/quick.md | CONNECTED |
| Directory reference | GSD-STYLE.md | .planning/quick/ | CONNECTED |

**Orphaned references:** 0
**Missing connections:** 0

### E2E Flow Verification

**Flow: User runs /gsd:quick**

| Step | Component | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|
| 1. Command invoke | /gsd:quick exists | VERIFIED |
| 2. Pre-flight validation | ROADMAP.md check | VERIFIED |
| 3. Get description | AskUserQuestion | VERIFIED |
| 4. Generate slug | Bash transformation | VERIFIED |
| 5. Calculate number | Sequential | VERIFIED |
| 6. Create directory | .planning/quick/NNN-slug/ | VERIFIED |
| 7. Spawn planner | gsd-planner (quick) | VERIFIED |
| 8. Spawn executor | gsd-executor | VERIFIED |
| 9. Update STATE.md | Quick Tasks table | VERIFIED |
| 10. Commit | Git commit | VERIFIED |

**Flow Status:** COMPLETE

---

## Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Issue | Severity | Action |
|------|-------|----------|--------|
| None | No TODO/FIXME/placeholder stubs | — | N/A |

All documentation is substantive with no placeholder patterns.

---

## Tech Debt Summary

**Total items:** 2

### Phase 01: Core Command
- No PLAN.md/SUMMARY.md artifacts (implementation was direct)
- Phase not executed through formal GSD workflow

**Impact:** Low - implementation is complete and functional
**Recommendation:** Accept as tech debt; workflow artifacts don't affect functionality

---

## Deferred Requirements (v2)

| ID | Description | Reason |
|----|-------------|--------|
| RESUME-01 | Parse decimal phase numbers | Requires /gsd:resume-work updates |
| RESUME-02 | Find decimal phase directories | Requires /gsd:resume-work updates |

These requirements are explicitly marked as v2 in REQUIREMENTS.md and were not part of the v1 milestone scope.

---

## Conclusion

**Milestone v1.0 - GSD Quick Mode is COMPLETE.**

All v1 requirements satisfied. Documentation complete and accurate. E2E flow verified. The `/gsd:quick` command is fully functional with proper state tracking and documentation.

The only tech debt is the missing Phase 01 workflow artifacts, which reflects an implementation approach rather than a functional gap.

<objective>
Document Quick Mode feature across three key documentation files.

Purpose: Ensure users can discover and understand Quick Mode through help.md (command reference), README.md (onboarding), and GSD-STYLE.md (patterns).
Output: Quick Mode documentation added to help.md, README.md, and GSD-STYLE.md

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Add Quick Mode section to help.md</name>
  <files>commands/gsd/help.md</files>
  <action>
    Add "Quick Mode" section after "Execution" section (around line 132).

    Section structure:
    - Heading: ### Quick Mode
    - Command reference: **`/gsd:quick`**
    - One-line description: "Execute small, ad-hoc tasks with GSD guarantees but skip optional agents."
    - Bullet points explaining key differences from full planning:
      - Spawns planner + executor (skips researcher, checker, verifier)
      - Quick tasks live in .planning/quick/ separate from planned phases
      - Updates STATE.md tracking (not ROADMAP.md)
    - Usage guidance: "Use when you know exactly what to do and the task is small enough to not need research or verification."
    - Usage syntax: Usage: `/gsd:quick`
    - Result: Creates `.planning/quick/NNN-slug/PLAN.md`, `.planning/quick/NNN-slug/SUMMARY.md`

    Placement: After "Execution" section, before "Roadmap Management" section (maintains user journey flow).

    DO NOT: Make entry verbose (help.md is reference, not tutorial). Keep to ~15 lines.
  </action>
  <verify>grep -A 10 "### Quick Mode" commands/gsd/help.md | grep -q "gsd:quick" && grep -q "planning/quick" commands/gsd/help.md</verify>
  <done>help.md has Quick Mode section with command, description, usage, and result</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add Quick Mode section to README.md</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
    Add Quick Mode documentation in TWO locations per STATE.md decision:

    1. Dedicated section (after "How It Works" section, around line 300):
       - Heading: ### Quick Mode (under "How It Works" as subsection)
       - Code block: /gsd:quick
       - Tagline: **For ad-hoc tasks that don't need full planning.**
       - Bullet points explaining what quick mode gives you:
         - Same agents — Planner + executor, same quality
         - Skips optional steps — No research, no plan checker, no verifier
         - Separate tracking — Lives in .planning/quick/, not phases
       - Use cases: bug fixes, small features, config changes, one-off tasks
       - Interactive example showing prompt flow
       - Output format showing created files

    2. Utilities table entry (in command reference tables section, around line 457):
       - Add row: | `/gsd:quick` | Execute ad-hoc task with GSD guarantees |
       - Match existing table format

    Tone: Conversational and user-facing (README.md is onboarding doc).
  </action>
  <verify>grep -q "### Quick Mode" README.md && grep -q "For ad-hoc tasks" README.md && grep -A 2 "gsd:quick" README.md | grep -q "Execute ad-hoc"</verify>
  <done>README.md has dedicated Quick Mode section AND utilities table entry</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Add Quick Mode Patterns section to GSD-STYLE.md</name>
  <files>GSD-STYLE.md</files>
  <action>
    Add "Quick Mode Patterns" section following existing style guide patterns (after "Scope Calibration" section, around line 379).

    Section structure:
    - Heading: ## Quick Mode Patterns
    - Intro paragraph: "Quick mode provides GSD guarantees for ad-hoc tasks without full planning overhead."
    - Subsection: ### When to Use Quick Mode
      - Comparison of quick mode vs full planning use cases (descriptive, not prescriptive)
      - Quick mode: small/self-contained, know exactly what to do, doesn't warrant full phase
      - Full planning: multiple subsystems, need investigation, part of larger phase, hidden complexity
    - Subsection: ### Quick Task Structure
      - Directory structure example
      - Numbering convention (3-digit sequential)
      - Slug format (kebab-case, max 40 chars)
    - Subsection: ### Quick Mode Tracking
      - STATE.md table format example
      - Note that STATE.md is updated, NOT ROADMAP.md
    - Subsection: ### Quick Mode Orchestration
      - Inline orchestration (no separate workflow)
      - Simplified flow steps
    - Subsection: ### Commit Convention
      - Commit message format example

    Tone: Descriptive and explanatory (GSD-STYLE.md describes patterns, doesn't prescribe rules).
    Include code examples where they illustrate structure clearly.

    DO NOT: Use prescriptive language like "always use quick mode for" or "never use quick mode when"
  </action>
  <verify>grep -q "## Quick Mode Patterns" GSD-STYLE.md && grep -q "### When to Use Quick Mode" GSD-STYLE.md && grep -q "planning/quick/" GSD-STYLE.md</verify>
  <done>GSD-STYLE.md has Quick Mode Patterns section with usage guidance, structure, tracking, and orchestration</done>
</task>
